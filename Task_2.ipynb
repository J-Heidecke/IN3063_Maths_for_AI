    "\n",
    "The second task is about classifying handwritten digits. We will use the MNIST dataset for training and testing. The point of this task is to develop a multi-layer neural network for classificationusing mostly Numpy:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Implement sigmoid and relu layers (with forward and backward pass)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Implement a softmax output layer\n",
    "\n",
    "• Implement a fully parameterizable neural network (number and types of layers, number of units)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Implement an optimizer(e.g. SGD or Adam)and a stopping criterionof your choosing\n",
    "• Train your Neural Network using backpropagation. Evaluate different neural network architectures andcompare your different results. You can also compare withthe results presented inhttp://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/"
